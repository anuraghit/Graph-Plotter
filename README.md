# Equation Grapher

The Equation Grapher is a web application that allows you to graph mathematical equations in a Cartesian coordinate system. You can enter various equations, graph them, and visualize the results.

## Features

- **Add Equations**: Enter mathematical equations, such as `x^2`, `sin(x)`, or any other valid expression.

- **Graph Multiple Equations**: You can add multiple equations and graph them simultaneously on the same chart.

- **Reset Graph**: Clear the graph to start fresh with new equations.

- **Circle Equation**: A circle with a radius of 10 and centered at (0, 0) is also included in the graph.

- **Equal Units**: The graph ensures that the number of pixels used for each unit on the x-axis is the same as on the y-axis, maintaining the aspect ratio.

- **Adjustable Y-Axis Length**: You can double the length of the y-axis while keeping the center of the circle at (0,0) and the radius at 10.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to access the Equation Grapher.

3. Enter mathematical equations in the input field and click "Add Equation."

4. Add multiple equations if desired.

5. Click the "Graph" button to visualize the equations on the Cartesian coordinate system.

6. To clear the graph and start over, click the "Reset" button.

## Examples

Here are some example equations you can try:

- `x^2`
- `sin(x)`
- `cos(x)`
- `x^3 + 2x^2 - 3x + 1`

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- JavaScript
- [Math.js](https://mathjs.org/) for mathematical expression parsing
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for graphing the equations
